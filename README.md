# HOME-LAB

This document are procedures steps in setting up multiple components in my home lab.
For my home lab I choose to use a INTEL NUC10i7FNK for the purposes of energy efficient. 
Thought I would have it for a while so used it as big investmenet to advance my career. 
You can find great cheap and older versions of the NUC with customization of memory and storage.

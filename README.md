# HOME-LAB WORKING PROGRESS
This project will ultiately be broken down into multiple projects 

# HOME-LAB

This document are procedures steps in setting up multiple components in my home lab.
For my home lab I choose to use a INTEL NUC10i7FNK for the purposes of energy efficient. 
Thought I would have it for a while so used it as big investmenet to advance my career. 
You can find great cheap and older versions of the NUC with customization of memory and storage. 


# Virtualization

To have the ability install multiple VMS on my box I choose the route of installing VMWare on my NUC. 
At this point I downloaded VmWare Vsphere from the website and bought a unlimited code from ebay that allows me to have no restriction. 
For the NUC you will have to install VMware(Esxi) on a bootable usb and boot NUC off of your USB.
